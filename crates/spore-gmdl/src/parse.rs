//! The gmdl record walk: header, referenced files, bounds, index buffers,
//! vertex descriptors, vertex buffers, mesh refs, materials, material info.
//!
//! # The `refCount` word is big-endian
//!
//! **Every other word in this format is little-endian. The reference-count
//! word alone is big-endian.** A little-endian read of a record with `N`
//! referenced files yields `N << 24` — 16 777 216 for a single reference — and
//! then the walk asks the record for `N << 24 * 12` bytes of file keys, which
//! runs straight off the end and either truncates mid-record or, worse, decodes
//! plausible nonsense out of geometry data.
//!
//! This is the single most expensive bug in this format's history. It was found
//! in this repository by reading a 175 KB record whose little-endian count came
//! out as `0x05000000` (`docs/CELLSTAGE-RECON.md` §2) and it explained 1 510 of
//! the 4 209 gmdl walk failures in `Spore_Content.package` — every record with
//! at least one reference. `tests/test_textures.py` pins it against three named
//! real records plus a strided 40-record sample; `tests/refcount_be.rs` pins it
//! again against synthetic records so it cannot regress in *this* crate.
//!
//! The reader keeps `read_u32` and `read_u32_be` as separate methods precisely
//! so that getting this wrong requires typing the exception.
//!
//! # Strict, then best-effort
//!
//! Everything from the version word through the end of the material info is
//! strict: a short buffer is a hard error. What follows — bone ranges, anim
//! data, baked deforms, the trailing key — is walked best-effort and never
//! fails a parse. That asymmetry is not laziness; it reflects what the records
//! actually contain. The trailer framing is verified on the `mini.gmdl` /
//! `CellImages` family, while the real cell-stage records at groups
//! `0x40616201`/`0x40616202` carry a larger opaque baked-deform trailer with a
//! different framing that overruns the known walk. Refusing those records would
//! throw away perfectly decodable geometry, so the tail is reported instead of
//! enforced: [`GmdlModel::strict_consumed`] and [`GmdlModel::consumed`] say
//! exactly how far each claim reaches, and [`GmdlModel::trailer`] says whether
//! the tail was walked at all.
