//! GMDL ("GameModel") decoder and static-mesh extractor.
//!
//! Spore's `gmdl` record — type id `0x00E6BCE5` — is its primary geometry
//! container: bounding box, index buffers, interleaved vertex buffers, mesh
//! references, materials and a shader/texture material-info section, wrapped in
//! an animation trailer. This crate decodes that record and extracts static
//! meshes from it. It is on the vertical slice's critical path
//! (DBPF record → gmdl → mesh → renderer) and is deliberately free of any
//! engine, GPU or I/O dependency so that `spore-assets` can adapt its output to
//! whatever renderer is in use.
//!
//! # What this crate is a port of
//!
//! Four sources describe the same layout, all in this repository and
//! cross-checked against each other:
//!
//! * `src/assets/Gmdl.cpp` / `Gmdl.hpp` — the C++ reference walk;
//! * `src/assets/Mesh.cpp` / `Mesh.hpp` — the C++ mesh extraction and bounds;
//! * `tools/spore/gmdl/gmdl.py` — a stdlib-only Python oracle, an independent
//!   decode of the same bytes;
//! * `docs/ASSET-PATH.md` §"Stage-by-stage decode" — the graded write-up of
//!   that path, whose evidence table this crate preserves.
//!
//! Where this port and the references disagree, the references win and the
//! divergence is a bug in this crate. Where the *format* is not understood, the
//! crate says so rather than filling the gap — see [`claims`], and the
//! documentation of [`mesh_from_gmdl`], which opens with that same warning about
//! the `UBYTE4` normal encoding.
//!
//! # The one thing to read before trusting this decoder
//!
//! **The gmdl `refCount` word is big-endian while every other word in the
//! record is little-endian.** A little-endian read multiplies the count by
//! `0x01000000` and walks the referenced-file table straight off the end of the
//! record. This was the most expensive bug in the format's history — 1 510 of
//! the 4 209 gmdl records in `Spore_Content.package` failed to walk because of
//! it — so it is spelled out at the call site, kept as a separate reader
//! method, and pinned by `tests/refcount_be.rs`.
//!
//! # Strict, then best-effort
//!
//! The walk from the version word through the material info is strict: a short
//! buffer is an error naming the section. The trailer after it (bone ranges,
//! anim data, baked deforms, trailing key) is best-effort and cannot fail a
//! parse, because real record families exist whose trailer framing this walk
//! does not know. That boundary is reported rather than hidden:
//! [`GmdlModel::strict_consumed`] is how far the walk actually read,
//! [`GmdlModel::consumed`] is always the input length, and
//! [`GmdlModel::trailer`] says whether the tail was reached at all.
//!
//! # Clean-room
//!
//! Nothing here is derived from EA or Maxis code. The layout was reconstructed
//! from the record bytes and the community SDK's type information, which
//! `docs/RECON-3.1.0.22.md` appendix A grades per claim.
