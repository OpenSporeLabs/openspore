//! `verify`: walk every record of a type and count what happened to each one.
//!
//! # Memory-flat by construction
//!
//! This is the command that will be pointed at the whole 995 MB
//! `Spore_Content.package`, so the constraint is not "be reasonably careful" — it
//! is that the resident set must not grow with the number of records walked.
//! Three properties give that:
//!
//! 1. the package is a **read-only memory map** ([`spore_assets::Package::open`]),
//!    so the image costs page cache, not heap;
//! 2. records are read **one at a time** into a buffer that is dropped at the end
//!    of each iteration — nothing accumulates, including the decoded value;
//! 3. the only things that survive the loop are **counters** and a small map of
//!    *distinct* error messages. That map is bounded by the number of distinct
//!    failures, which is a property of the data rather than of its size.
//!
//! `Container` rows are not read at all: the classification says this build does
//! not parse them, so reading 30 000 bytes to learn nothing would be the
//! opposite of flat. [`RecordClass::NoDecoder`] rows likewise.
//!
//! # Progress
//!
//! Every [`PROGRESS_EVERY`] records a one-line progress note goes to `err`. It is
//! gated on a boolean the caller supplies from [`stderr_is_terminal`], rather
//! than guessed here, so a test can exercise the line and a redirected report can
//! opt out of it. A progress line interleaved with a captured log is noise a
//! reviewer has to filter out.
