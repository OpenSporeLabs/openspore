//! One module per subcommand.
//!
//! Each `run` takes a fully parsed request and a `&mut dyn Write`, returns a
//! [`ToolError`], and holds no global state. That is the whole contract: the
//! argument parser lives in [`crate`], the command bodies here, and the binary in
//! `main.rs` is a shim. Nothing in this module reads the clock, the environment
//! or the terminal except where a behaviour is explicitly about a terminal
//! (`verify`'s progress line).
//!
//! # The decoded / type-level rule
//!
//! Every printed line that makes a claim about a record is one of two things,
//! and the wording says which:
//!
//! * **type-level** — a fact about the *type table*: "this build has a decoder
//!   family for `gmdl`", "`png` is a container this build does not decode".
//!   Cheap, computed from the type id alone, and true before any record is read.
//! * **decoded** — a fact about *these bytes*: "1 mesh, 50 vertices, stride 16",
//!   only ever printed after a decoder returned a value.
//!
//! A line that is neither must say so explicitly rather than borrow the
//! formatting of one that is. [`describe`] is where the distinction earns its
//! keep: a `plt` record prints its index extent and the sentence "this build has
//! no decoder for type 0x011989b7", never a mesh count.
