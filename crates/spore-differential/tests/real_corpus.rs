//! Real-corpus differential tests. **Every test here is `#[ignore]`d.**
//!
//! These need the installed game data, which is git-ignored and about 5 GB:
//!
//! ```text
//! SPORE/Data/*.package          Spore_Content.package is 995 MB,
//! SPORE/DataEP1/*.package       Spore_Graphics.package is 943 MB
//! ```
//!
//! `cargo test -p spore-differential` therefore does **not** run them, and
//! `cargo test --workspace` stays hermetic and fast. To run them:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p spore-differential --release -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! `--release` matters: QFS decompression of ~5 GB and a Python oracle
//! re-reading a 995 MB package are both dominated by interpreter and
//! allocator cost, and a debug build turns a ten-minute run into an hour.
//! `--nocapture` matters because each test prints its report; the divergences
//! are the deliverable and a passing `ok` line hides them.
//!
//! Each test asserts something narrow rather than "no differences", because
//! some differences are already known and are findings rather than bugs (see
//! the notes inside). Where a difference is a bug in the Rust port, the test
//! asserts it *is* present so the harness cannot quietly start reporting zero.
//! That is deliberate: this suite's job is to report the truth, and a
//! regression test that encodes "clean" as correct would encode a lie the first
//! time the truth was "diverged".
