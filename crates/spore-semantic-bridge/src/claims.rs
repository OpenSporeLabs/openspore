//! What this crate does **not** know.
//!
//! The repository's convention is that a format crate carries a `claims` module
//! listing its non-findings, and that claims are extended rather than deleted
//! when something is inconvenient. This one is long, and every entry is either
//! a limit of the *format*, a limit of *this reader*, or a deliberate refusal to
//! repair something upstream.
//!
//! Read it before trusting an answer. A `Fact::unavailable` says OpenSpore
//! looked and found nothing; the entries below say what "nothing" can mean.

/// Claim ids are stable so a doc or a test can refer to one without quoting it.
///
/// They are plain constants rather than an enum because an enum would have to be
/// exhaustive, and the whole point of this module is that it is not: the next
/// thing someone learns belongs here too.
