//! Turning a gmdl record's texture references into images, and reporting what
//! had to be assumed to do it.
//!
//! # The three steps, and what each one costs in honesty
//!
//! 1. **A `GmdlTextureRef` is `{instance, group}`.** No type word. So the lookup
//!    key is completed with the caller's [`assumed_type`](resolve_texture)
//!    parameter, and
//!    [`claims::ASSUMED_RECORD_TYPE`] records that the type was **assumed**, at
//!    [`spore_core::evidence::EvidenceLevel::Inferred`].
//! 2. **The record is read and decoded as a raster.** A type word that names
//!    something other than [`spore_texture::RASTER_TYPE`] is refused *by type*,
//!    even when the record exists there: `png`-typed records are raw PNG and
//!    `rw4`-typed records are RenderWare containers, and neither is a raster.
//! 3. **The base image is published**, together with the mip and layer counts and
//!    the claim set. A record with more than one layer, or with a mip chain, is
//!    not flattened into a guess about which layer is which role.
//!
//! # Failures are per reference, never per batch
//!
//! [`resolve_model_textures`] returns one `Result` per reference, in encounter
//! order, and a failing reference never removes a succeeding one. That is not a
//! convenience: it is what the documented asset requires. `osptool describe` on
//! `0x00e6bce5:0x40637e03:0x067a07f0` (2026-10-04) reports three texture
//! references, and `osptool describe` on
//! `0x2f4e681c:0x40632902:0x067a07f0` refuses it with
//! `unsupported fourcc 0x00000015`. A resolver that stopped at the first failure
//! would return **no textures at all** for the one asset this repository
//! documents end to end.
