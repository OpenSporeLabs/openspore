//! Typed failures of material and texture resolution.
//!
//! One variant per failure mode, because the three things that can go wrong
//! here call for three different responses and an operator cannot tell them
//! apart from one string:
//!
//! * the record is **not in the store** — a missing asset, or a wrong assumed
//!   type, and the near-miss candidates `spore-assets` already collected;
//! * the record **is there but this crate will not decode it as a texture** —
//!   `png`- and `rw4`-typed records are real records that are not raster
//!   records, and conflating them is precisely the bug this type prevents;
//! * the record **is a raster of a format this build does not decode** — the
//!   `0x15xx` luminance family, which is refused by name.
//!
//! Each variant names the [`ResourceKey`] it is about, so "while loading X" can
//! be logged without matching every arm. [`MaterialError::key`] does that.
//!
//! # PartialEq, not Eq
//!
//! [`spore_gmdl::GmdlError`] carries `f32`s and derives `PartialEq` only
//! (`NaN != NaN` is the point there), so this type cannot derive `Eq`. Tests in
//! this workspace compare asset errors far more often than they hash them.
