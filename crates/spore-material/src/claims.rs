//! Every claim this crate records, with the grade it is recorded at.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! This crate sits between a gmdl record and a renderer, and the gap it walks
//! over is *naming*: a gmdl record carries a 32-bit material id and a list of
//! `{instance, group}` texture references, and neither of those things says
//! what anything is called. If a resolver returns a bare `Vec<u8>` of RGBA and
//! a `material_id: u32`, then by the time the renderer sees the texture the
//! three questions a caller actually has — *what is this material?*, *which
//! sampler is this texture bound to?*, *how do you know the record was a
//! raster at all?* — have been answered silently, or not at all.
//!
//! So each of those answers is recorded here **as a graded statement**, and the
//! grades are deliberately not flattering:
//!
//! * a **material id has no known meaning** in this build and no name is
//!   invented from it (`no_material_registry`);
//! * the **16 bytes** a gmdl texture-set entry skips before `{instance, group}`
//!   are not decoded, so **no sampler role** is claimed
//!   (`texture_entry_header_not_decoded`);
//! * a **texture reference carries no type word**, so the record type is an
//!   explicit caller-supplied assumption, graded [`EvidenceLevel::Inferred`]
//!   rather than observed.
//!
//! The reference implementation never learned the material mapping either:
//! `src/assets/MaterialRegistry.cpp` keeps a registry the engine populates from
//! outside, which is why "no registry" is a statement about the *format*, not
//! about a gap in this crate.
//!
//! # Grading, stated per claim
//!
//! [`ALL_CLAIMS`] is the single table of (subject, grade, why). The resolution
//! code builds its [`Fact`]s through the helpers here, and a test asserts that
//! every recorded fact's level equals [`grade_of`] for its subject — so the
//! grade a caller reads and the grade this module documents cannot drift apart.
//!
//! Absent answers are [`Fact::unavailable`], which by construction carries
//! `EvidenceLevel::Unknown`, `EvidenceState::Missing` and **no provenance**. A
//! non-finding is not a zero, not an empty string and not a default colour; see
//! `spore_core::evidence`.
