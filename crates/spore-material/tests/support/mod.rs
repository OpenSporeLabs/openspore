//! Synthetic fixtures: a DBPF image, raster records, and gmdl records.
//!
//! **No committed raster or gmdl fixture is usable here.** The real records live
//! in the git-ignored `SPORE/` tree, so every byte below is built in the test.
//! The committed `tests/fixtures/mini.gmdl` belongs to `spore-gmdl`'s own
//! integration tests and says nothing about a *model* that carries texture
//! references, which is the only thing this crate consumes.
//!
//! # Written from the format, not from the readers
//!
//! Each builder is written from the layout as documented in the reader's own
//! source — `spore-dbpf`'s `index.rs`, `spore-texture`'s `raster.rs`,
//! `spore-gmdl`'s `parse.rs` — and not from a call into the decoder. A builder
//! that shared code with the reader would round-trip perfectly while both were
//! wrong together, which is the failure mode `spore-gmdl`'s own test support is
//! written to avoid.
//!
//! # The realism that matters
//!
//! The gmdl builder defaults to the *documented asset*'s material section,
//! measured with `osptool` on `SPORE/Data/Spore_Content.package` (2026-10-04):
//! one material id `0x407DFDDB`, three texture references with
//! `instance_id = 0x067a07f0` and groups `0x40632900`, `0x40632901`,
//! `0x40632902` — the third of which is a `0x15` luminance record this build
//! refuses.
