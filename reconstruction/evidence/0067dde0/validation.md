# Validation 0x0067dde0

- Static reconstruction: `WARN`
- Runtime (original process): `GATED`
- Source: `src/reconstruction/pkg_runtime_services_wave7/runtime_services_wave7.cpp`

The two axes are independent. A static verdict says the reconstruction agrees with the
binary; it says nothing about the original process, and is never a runtime claim.

## Static checks

| Check | Status | Coverage | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| ABI | `WARN` | `partial` | derived calling-convention confidence is UNKNOWN; the oracle is not proven |
| CALLS | `PASS` | `complete` | the machine-vs-machine rule: the xref export and the complete 2-instruction listing each record no outgoing transfer, which is evidence that this target makes no call; the source span names none either; the xref export at /home/juanr/Proyectos/OpenSpore/knowledgegraph/triage/xrefs-2540f2ca.tsv is read whole: 0 outgoing call edge row(s) over 0 distinct address(es) for 0x0067dde0; 1 incoming call edge row(s) reach it, which the record's bounded projection counts against the same 30-row window but which are not callees |
| GLOBALS | `WARN` | `partial` | the complete 2-instruction listing names 1 data address(es) (0x15fd8ec) and the xref export carries no data-reference edge type, so there is nothing to corroborate them against; read/write mode still needs per-access evidence |
| FIELDS/OFFSETS | `WARN` | `partial` | 1 source field-offset declaration(s) (field cheat_manager_015fd8ec) are reconstruction-declared and no machine-derived struct layout exists to corroborate them: this target has no complete listing, or its ABI record names no receiver register to check them against |
| CONSTANTS | `PASS` | `complete` | the machine listing is fully parsed (2 of 2 instruction(s), 0 unparsed) and the source span states no hexadecimal constant for it to lack |
| CONTROL FLOW | `PASS` | `complete` | the complete 2-instruction listing contains no conditional branch, which is itself the evidence that the body is straight-line; the source span declares no branch keyword, and keyword shape is a source-side signal that is not part of this verdict |
| VIRTUAL DISPATCH | `PASS` | `complete` | the complete 2-instruction body names no indirect transfer through a register or a memory operand and the machine dispatch record agrees at 0, so neither the body nor the source span claims virtual dispatch |
| RETURN SEMANTICS | `PASS` | `complete` | the source span declares return type 'OpaqueCheatManager*' and the machine return state is WIDTH_4_IN_EAX: the complete 2-instruction listing writes EAX at a determinate 4-byte width before all 1 reachable return(s); the width is a machine fact and the C type of that width is a source-side choice. The width is corroborated by the machine; the exact C type spelling remains a source-side choice among the types of that width and is not verified here. |

Static evidence basis: 8 of 8 static checks evaluated, 5 passed, 0 had no evidence to evaluate; 11 of 17 static evidence categories available.

Evidence coverage is a measurement, not a verdict: `WARN` -- 11 of 17 static evidence categories are available

## Runtime

- Status: `GATED`
- Original-process observations validated: `0`
- Reason: no original-process trace exists in this repository; the gate is open, nothing was attempted, and nothing failed
- Open runtime gates: `required`

A gated runtime is an open capability gate on the original process. Nothing was
attempted and nothing failed.

## Unresolved questions

- Does any caller require non-null service semantics?
- What startup and teardown paths replace or clear the slot?
- Which concrete cheat manager is published at 0x015fd8ec?
- required
