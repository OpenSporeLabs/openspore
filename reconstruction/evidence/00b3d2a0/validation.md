# Validation 0x00b3d2a0

- Static reconstruction: `NOT_AVAILABLE`
- Runtime (original process): `GATED`
- Source: `src/reconstruction/pkg01_roots/pkg01_roots.cpp`

The two axes are independent. A static verdict says the reconstruction agrees with the
binary; it says nothing about the original process, and is never a runtime claim.

## Static checks

| Check | Status | Coverage | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| ABI | `WARN` | `partial` | the derived ABI record abstained (ABI_UNKNOWN): no_discriminator: no stack-argument read and no positive receiver evidence |
| CALLS | `PASS` | `complete` | the machine-vs-machine rule: the xref export and the complete 2-instruction listing each record no outgoing transfer, which is evidence that this target makes no call; the source span names none either; the xref export at /home/juanr/Proyectos/OpenSpore/knowledgegraph/triage/xrefs-2540f2ca.tsv is read whole: 0 outgoing call edge row(s) over 0 distinct address(es) for 0x00b3d2a0; 510 incoming call edge row(s) reach it, which the record's bounded projection counts against the same 30-row window but which are not callees; the record's edges_truncated flag is set, and it is computed over this record's incoming and outgoing call rows together, so incoming edges alone can set it; the export records 0 outgoing call edge row(s) for this target, which is the count that bounds a callee set |
| GLOBALS | `WARN` | `partial` | the complete 2-instruction listing names 1 data address(es) (0x167eae4) and the xref export carries no data-reference edge type, so there is nothing to corroborate them against; read/write mode still needs per-access evidence |
| FIELDS/OFFSETS | `NOT_AVAILABLE` | `none` | the source span declares no field offset, and no machine-derived receiver evidence is collected for this target (the listing is absent or the ABI record names no receiver register); the record names 2 type(s) |
| CONSTANTS | `PASS` | `complete` | the machine listing is fully parsed (2 of 2 instruction(s), 0 unparsed) and the source span states no hexadecimal constant for it to lack |
| CONTROL FLOW | `PASS` | `complete` | the complete 2-instruction listing contains no conditional branch, which is itself the evidence that the body is straight-line; the source span declares no branch keyword, and keyword shape is a source-side signal that is not part of this verdict |
| VIRTUAL DISPATCH | `PASS` | `complete` | the complete 2-instruction body names no indirect transfer through a register or a memory operand and the machine dispatch record agrees at 0, so neither the body nor the source span claims virtual dispatch |
| RETURN SEMANTICS | `PASS` | `complete` | the source span declares return type 'OpaqueStarManager*' and the machine return state is WIDTH_4_IN_EAX: the complete 2-instruction listing writes EAX at a determinate 4-byte width before all 1 reachable return(s); the width is a machine fact and the C type of that width is a source-side choice. The width is corroborated by the machine; the exact C type spelling remains a source-side choice among the types of that width and is not verified here. |

Static evidence basis: 7 of 8 static checks evaluated, 5 passed, 1 had no evidence to evaluate; 12 of 17 static evidence categories available.

Evidence coverage is a measurement, not a verdict: `WARN` -- 12 of 17 static evidence categories are available

## Runtime

- Status: `GATED`
- Original-process observations validated: `0`
- Reason: no original-process trace exists in this repository; the gate is open, nothing was attempted, and nothing failed
- Open runtime gates: `observe_global_slot_0167eae4`

A gated runtime is an open capability gate on the original process. Nothing was
attempted and nothing failed.

## Unresolved questions

- Can consumers observe a null or stale alternate pointer during mode transition?
- Is DAT_0167eae4 value-equal to the canonical star-manager slot DAT_0167eb0c for the full live lifecycle?
- What code publishes, replaces, or clears DAT_0167eae4?
- What exact concrete type and vtable identity does the returned manager have?
- Which code owns the alternate manager's lifetime and teardown?
- concrete type
- initialization and lifetime
- live owner
- observe_global_slot_0167eae4
- runtime value
